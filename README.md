## 2D code for diffusion simulation using Crank-Nicolson Method

## 1D Non-Dimensional code for autochemotaxis

We now attempt to solve a coupled system of PDEs that captures the density of plankton evolving with the concentration of a chemical that they themselves are producing and moving towards, i.e. plankton performing chemotaxis. Utilizing a Crank-Nicolson method, we simulate the different enviromental possibilies to try to mimic the real world aggregations that are shown by plankton.
